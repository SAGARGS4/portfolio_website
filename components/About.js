			<p className="mb-4">
				I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Information Science at CMR
				Institute of Technology with a strong focus on modern web technologies.
				I am skilled in full-stack development, particularly the MERN stack. I
				aim to build clean, scalable solutions that effectively solve real-world
				problems.
			</p>
			<p className="mb-4">
				Outside of coding, I love experiencing life through new perspectives —
				whether it’s traveling to unfamiliar places, trying different cuisines,
				or simply exploring nature. These moments refresh my creativity and
				often give me fresh insights that I bring back into my work. Exploring
				new places fuels my curiosity and helps me connect with people from
				diverse backgrounds.
